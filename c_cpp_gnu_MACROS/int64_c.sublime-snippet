<!-- 

Defined to implementations of the standard stdint.h macros with the same names without the leading __. They exist the make the implementation of that header work correctly. You should not use these macros directly; instead, include the appropriate headers. Some of these macros may not be defined on particular systems if GCC does not provide a stdint.h header on those systems.
